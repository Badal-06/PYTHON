# 🐍 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Welcome to the **OOPS_in_Python** section of my Python learning journey!  
This folder contains hands-on code examples and mini-projects that demonstrate the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming using Python.

---

## 📚 What’s Inside?

- **Class & Object Basics:**  
  - Creating classes and objects  
  - Accessing instance and class variables  
  - Using methods and constructors

- **OOP Principles:**  
  - Inheritance (Single, Multi-level, Multiple, Hierarchical)  
  - Method Overriding and `super()`  
  - Operator Overloading  
  - Nested Classes  
  - Passing objects as arguments

- **Advanced OOP:**  
  - Abstract Classes & Methods (using `abc` module)  
  - Static Methods & Class Methods  
  - Property Decorators

- **Practical Examples:**  
  - Bank account simulation  
  - Student average and percentage calculation  
  - Car control with static methods  
  - Complex number addition

## 📝 How to Use

Each `.py` file is a self-contained example with comments for easy understanding.  
Feel free to run, modify, and experiment with the code to deepen your OOP knowledge!

## 🚀 Why OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming helps you:
- Organize code for real-world modeling
- Reuse and extend code efficiently
- Write cleaner, more maintainable programs

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By going through the code in this repo, you will learn:

- How to design Python classes effectively.
- How inheritance helps in reusing code.
- How polymorphism allows flexibility in method usage.
- The difference between class methods, static methods, and instance methods.
- How Python supports abstraction and operator overloading.

---

## 📖 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required – everything is based on core Python.

---
