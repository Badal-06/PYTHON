# 🌐 Arduino Projects – IoT Learning

Welcome to the **Arduino** section of the [IOT_LEARNING](https://github.com/Badal-06/IOT_LEARNING) repository!  
This area is dedicated to hands-on IoT projects using Arduino boards, sensors, and actuators.  
Whether you’re a beginner or an enthusiast, you’ll find practical examples to help you learn and build real-world IoT solutions.

---

## ⚡ What You'll Learn

- How to interface sensors (temperature, distance, etc.) with Arduino
- Controlling actuators like LEDs and buzzers
- Displaying sensor data on LCDs
- Building interactive projects such as traffic lights and distance measurement systems
- Basics of circuit wiring and Arduino programming

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

Depending on the project, you may need:

- Arduino Uno, Nano, or compatible board
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- LEDs, buzzers, resistors
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- LCD display (16x2)
- Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT11)
- Other basic electronic components

*Each project folder contains a list of specific hardware needed.*

---

## 💻 Software Requirements

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- Required Arduino libraries (install via Library Manager as needed)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Badal-06/IOT_LEARNING.git
   cd IOT_LEARNING/Arduino
   ```

2. **Open a project folder** (e.g., `LED_Control`) and open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.

3. **Connect your Arduino board** via USB.

4. **Select the correct board and port** in the IDE.

5. **Upload the code** to your Arduino.

---

## 🌟 Example Projects

- **LED_Control:** Turn LEDs on/off or blink them using Arduino.
- **Buzzer_Control:** Generate sound alerts with a buzzer.
- **Temperature_Sensor:** Read and display temperature sensor data.
- **Traffic_Light_Control:** Simulate a traffic light system with LEDs.
- **Distance_Measurement_LCD:** Measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor and display it on an LCD.

---

## 🔌 Circuit Diagrams

Each project folder may include a circuit diagram or Fritzing file to help you wire up the components correctly.

---

## 📡 Usage

- After uploading the sketch, connect the required sensors and actuators as shown in the circuit diagram.
- Use the Serial Monitor (Ctrl + Shift + M) to view real-time data if available.
- For projects with LCDs, observe the output directly on the display.
